Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

forks copies a repository to my Github online. 

clones:  it copies a repository from Gibhub to my local computer

Branches:  it is more related to commits. 


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In that case, we can tell if we need to either Merge or Fetch from Github by looking at codes in Github.  

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    That would be so hard.  Especially without commits, you won't be able to notice important steps of each important changes.  

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    With a separate branch, we can try something that we need to risk of messing up the original code.
